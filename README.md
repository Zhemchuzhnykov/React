# React

My React projects.

## Repository Structure

These projects are added to this git repository as submodules. Please visit the file .gitmodules to find the links to any of these projects.

Every project has a folder with its source code and README file in which the concepts that were practiced are listed.

## Projects

### Animal Fun Facts

A simple game in wich you can click on one of the pictures with some animal and get an interesting fact displayed about the selected animal.

### Starting Project

A simple interactive application where you can select menu tabs that open up different section with the information about React.

### Tic-Tac-Toe Game

A two-players game with logging the game turns, result announcement, ability to change players' names, and, of course, the interactive gaming board.

### Investment Calculator

The calculator that dynamically calculates investment values based on your input. A user can specify an initial investment value, annual additional investment, annual interest rate, and duration of the investment in years. The app outputs the table in which each row includes the year of the investment, total value of the investment, interest earned during this year, total interest earned, and total invested capital.

### Investment Calculator: Bug Fixing

This project represents the same app and, fundamentally, same code as the project "Investment Calculator". The only difference is that, in this project, bugs were artificially created for practicing the skills of debugging, finding errors, and bug fixing. The skillset practiced in this project and artificial bug scenarios are amply described in the project repository.

### Styling Demo Project

Functionally, this project is a simple sign-in form with minimum functionality: validation of user inputs. For example, the label and input field will turn red if a user's input is not validated according to the validation rules set in the application. The whole idea about this project is showing up different approaches of styling a React app. You will find 8 branches, except for the master branch, in this project. Each branch is specifically responsible for a certain styling approach.
